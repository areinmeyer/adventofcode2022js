# Advent Of Code 2022

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022)
I'll track this year's Advent of Code using the following guidelines:
* The environment will run in Node.js, supporting LTS or higher
* All examples will use Typescript
* Design as functionally as possible, and allow [Ramda](https://ramdajs.com/docs/#) to support FP when appropriate

## Structure
Each day will have it's own folder.  The plan is to create a script for each day.  I may pull some functions out into a utility folder depending on the solutions each day and if they build off of each other.

I'll add linting and a formatter too.
